        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">About Me:</h1>
        <p>I'm Chelsey Ko, a sixteen-year-old high school student. This summer as I've been completing this course in Web Design, I've learned how to code in HTML and CSS language, design principles in how to make a visually appealing and interactive website, and learned about the various careers available in Web Design. This was the first time I had ever learned how to code. Over this past summer, I've created two websites and a collection of media that will all be featured on this site as a portfolio.</p><br>
        <p>I currently attend Bishop Ireton High School and am graduate the following spring in May. Following my high school career, I wish to study Biotechnology in college with the intention to pursue a career in the medical field.</p><br>
